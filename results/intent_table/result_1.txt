Now do I need to go to Joe's office? He's not coming to my house is he?	3
That's fine. I'll go to his office. Is he still at the corner of James and Harrison Streets?	3
Okay. And it's just random, which of the three pops up?	3
I see, okay. What does the Preferred package cover?	3
What are the costs for the two different packages?	3
Okay, and the Basic would be cheaper.	3
Well, how many you have there Missy?	3
#Um yes okay Carrie. Do you have a direct line to you or...?	3
Yep my birthday is the fourteenth of August nineteen seventy two, and I'll just have to look that up, where's tha- is that in the booklets you sent in the mail?	3
What about vandalism or robbery?	3
Hi, thanks for waiting. I think we're actually interested in the middle plan, the one with the both house and belongings included, but I think we'd like to review the fine print before we move forward.	3
Will it come to my father's address?	3
Will they require notarization?	3
Wow! Where will they come?	3
Yes. I would like to remove Lizzy, but leave the other two women on my policy.	3
I want to take care of this A-S-A-P.	3
No, I think that's all. You've been very helpful. If you are ever in Albany please let me know and I'll send you some complimentary tickets for my magic show.	3
What are they?	3
What's the downside to that?	3
What's Term mean?	3
What can you do about it?	3
And what are you going to do about it?	3
I want someone punished! I've had to deal with this for three months. It's ridiculous! And why didn't anyone else catch this?	3
#Uh I'm bad at thinking of stuff on the spot. Do you have suggestions I can just pick from?	3
#Uh jeez, why did I pick that one? #Um mister Hawkins?	3
And what all does the one I'm on now cover? Complete Auto?	3
What's that mean?	3
What's, the address?	3
Could you tell me about your, like, speed tracking? Like how it works and stuff?	3
OK, so I've got, I mean, yeah, they're healthy, no pre-existing conditions. I've got some medical files, some documents. Should I send you those? Would you need to see them?	3
What about, like, new technology, like those cars that show you, show you what's behind so you can reverse? Or they like beep if you get too- too close to.	3
And any meds? And, would- is he covered for, like, follow-up appointments?	3
Yeah, well, it's- I mean, she can't really complain. So do I need to, do anything?	3
Does it, like, matter if I haven't, found a place yet? Because I, like, submitted some, rental applications to, like, three places.	3
Cool! So, OK, like, me and my friend are getting a place together, so, like, would we, or could we, share a policy?	3
OK. Yeah, maybe the lower, I mean, the three eighteen is better. And what if I, or we, or I guess even just me, what if I move? Like, would I lose my coverage? Would I, like, have to pay to keep it?	3
Hello Timmy this is Betty, widow of Omar. I am calling today to get my life insured. I have never done this. Omar went to see Jesus and did not come back. He kept him.	3
After the Omar met Jesus certificate and stayed what happens next?	3
I had someone contact her on LinkedIn, and she talked up a storm there. Absolutely refused to talk about work. That was my plan. Instead she goes off and talks about life. I liked it. Had to marry her. Marian knows too much about me. It has been love sickness with me ever since. Cannot get enough of her. I need to get her on the insurances and want a life insurance policy for her alone.	3
Let's move forward. I need to add Marian as a beneficiary to all the other policies I have with you.	3
How do you retain the good of what was while moving forward with the good you have with the one now without the inevitable feeling of betrayal?	3
You about done philospher Tim. Is that your next ad campaign?	3
Is my premium going up? Oh Louise is going to be mad when we do not make ballroom dancing tonight. Better not go home.	3
Does my policy get me a pretty nurse?	3
It's a cyber attack. A big one. oh my goodness it's ransomware just everywhere. Over two hundred companies hit. What should we do Timothy?	3
#Um do you think that is wise?	3
Is that a new process Timothy?	3
Is there anything I can do to help since I caused it?	3
Do they do residential? Might be fun to get a lesson or two in and secure my personal information on my devices.	3
I would love that, Timothy. If you do something I would pilot for you as well.	3
Timothy this is Charlsie Wiley. #Um my husband God rest his soul his perfect soil. Died in an accident of his making. I need to discuss the financial matter of life insurance.	3
Did I make Roger the beneficiary?	3
#Um James decided to find a room rather than the dorm. #Uh how do we insure that, Timothy?	3
Is that house or apartment, Timothy?	3
Hi Timothy! This is Geraldine from church. I doing some considerations. I need your help in deciding some things to add to my house.	3
He was in the Korean War and though the memory is strong the body is more frail. Rather than a tussle with a thief thought I would take him to a room. Running away from tornado well Timothy we do not run fast.We sashay. I need a room.	3
Change it to complete auto and is that with the all inclusive discount since I have my house with you as well.	3
Life insurance. Add a policy the cheapest one you have. Have young son who is an adult coming back home. Out of drug rehab again.	3
#Uh did not pass the drug test and why the rehab. Got caught again which is a good thing.	3
Will it have the medical?	3
What about mileage, Craig?	3
Hello Craig. This is Garland. Where is Timothy?	3
Is that something new from climate change?	3
Fred died Craig. Don't you read the obits? Looking for temporary players.	3
Understood, Craig. How high can I go?	3
Timothy, I'm Doris Wooster I go to church with you. Someone told me I needed to chat with you about insurance.	3
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Brad isn't going to make it, Timothy, and most likely will be killed in prison. I don't want to pay out of pocket for the burial. I was looking for a way to do that. Why should my finances be drained for things Brad did? That's the problem with illegal drug use it drains the family's finances.	3
Oh awesome, that is cheaper than what we are playing now. Now what about renters?	3
Now why would she do that and not say anything? You gonna blame her for the date change too?	3
#Uh, sorry? What birthday? I am not having birthday today.	3
Any more details for identification?	3
Why do you need that?	3
#Uh, yes, what has that got to do with this?	3
Right, right, swiida. #Uh, why is it saying it cannot recognize the user?	3
Must the address be a home address.	3
#Uh, sorry? what birthday? I'm not having birthday today.	3
Okay, can I use my childhood nickname?	3
What's the real difference between preffered and basic though?	3
Hey I would like to my home address.	3
Can I know some of your packages?	3
That sounds pretty good, but why would I have to submit to a medical exam?	3
Um, that sounds good, but what if I wanted to get her more?	3
Okay, what kind of test and treatments does it cover?	3
Yes, how do I... sorry I'm digging for my wallet, how do I find out which doctors are in-network?	3
Any more details for identification?	3
It's Okay, Have you detected the cause?	3
Quite affordable. So how do each of them operate?	3
Okay that's great thank you, sorry, I just-you know-I just wanted to talk to a real person instead of a robot or something.	3
Must the address be a home address.	3
#Uh, yes, what has that got to do with this?	3
Right, right, swiida. #Uh, why is it saying it cannot recognize the user?	3
#Uh, sorry? What birthday? I am not having birthday today.	3
Okay what do I stand to gain by insuring with you?	3
#Uh, sorry? what birthday? I'm not having birthday today.	3
What do they do?	3
And what about the last one, Com- Comprehensive?	3
Oh, that makes sense. Does anything else affect it?	3
It's Okay, Have you detected the cause?	3
Any more details for identification?	3
Hey I would like to my home address.	3
Quite affordable. So how do each of them operate?	3
I don't need to know your name, just get me to a manager immediately.	3
It was his fault! Why am I paying - medical expenses? I didn't go to the hospital.	3
He was lying on the ground faking pain in his shoulder. You should have seen him - rolling around the ground screaming in Spanish. I mean is he even here legally?	3
Any more details for identification?	3
#Ah yeah it's a duplex, like my current property now. The only thing is we're re-doing the furniture though so I think we'd probably have to update the value of our belongings, right?	3
Can I know some of your packages?	3
Why do you need that?	3
Okay, can I use my childhood nickname?	3
Where would that even be?	3
OK, that is fine. Will my son have access to the same doctors and networks that I do?	3
#Uh, can you hold for a moment? I want to see if Nancy is awake.	3
Hello, is this a person?	3
Could you explain them to me?	3
Okay, makes sense. Are all health-related appointments covered?	3
What was your name, so I can ask for you?	3
Oh why did I choose this one? Okay, so I attended two different high schools so it'll either be Bell Flower High School or Riverside High School.	3
I knew it. How about the rental?	3
Oh, that's not a bad price. What if we wanted to be able to rent while we went on vacation ourselves, is that included?	3
Do you really need all of this just to stop something I never asked for?	3
What about for me and my wife? Does it offer any addtional services?	3
Does it offer any other services?	3
Why would you need to know how many square feet?	3
Why in the world would I keep them? Won't the mildew start to grow?	3
Okay even if I do that what about the cabinets? They are starting to mildew as well.	3
Where is this hotel? What's the address?	3
So i was wondering if the company has a branch over there.	3
Why's that?	3
So are we done?	3
Yeah, where are you?	3
#Uh, could you explain them for me also?	3
Yes. What can that money be used for if the person dies? I mean, other than a funeral?	3
Are you from the south, too?	3
#Oh, okay. So am I able to proceed without that exam for the moment? Like, figure out how much I'd pay and all that?	3
Okay, yeah. I I don't have a primary physician at this time, so I'll have to find one. I'll call with the updated information when I do, though. Actually, is there, is there another way to update the information or is this it? I was on hold for like twenty minutes.	3
What does that mean?	3
What does that mean?	3
So what can we do then?	3
Oh, and why is that if I may ask?	3
Alright, which are those?	3
Alright, which are those?	3
Do I really need to give all this information, just to remove Ryan as a dedpendent?	3
Alright, which are those?	3
What the heck! Why isn't anything working?	3
Great, and what do I need to do, once my wife and I make a decision?	3
Alright, which are those?	3
Alright, which are those?	3
What the heck! Why isn't anything working?	3
Alright, which are those?	3
I tried blocking them, but somehow they have two lines and just tried with a different number! Tried to shave a hundred dollars off the price if I came back in. Why not just give me the price it's worth? Why?	3
So what's that one?	3
And I was wondering, how does that all work? Aren't we, Lucy? We're just sitting here wondering.	3
Well, what about the emergency ones? That's what Lucy and I want to know .	3
And that whole thing cost me five hundred dollars alone! What am I gonna do if she gets it in her head to go back to those burrs?	3
Well, I-I don't know about that. I mean, will Doctor Jacob accept the insurance? I'll just have to ask him and maybe call back later.	3
Well, what if she wanders into the burrs before then? You never know about Lucy!	3
Do, medical conditions influence it?	3
What? This is ridiculous. Why can't you just fix it?	3
Okay what are they?	3
Oh I don't have all of that right now. Can I just give you their name?	3
How do I get proof of that?	3
Well where could it be?	3
can you eat or wear your bonus?	3
How long does it take to get the proof?	3
So, do I need to call him or what do I need to do?	3
Great. Thank you. Will I need to be there or can anyone be there?	3
Why do you need that?	3
What all kinds do you have?	3
Yes she really is a blessing. Do you have any grandkids?	3
Do you have anyone closer to the Pace area? I will be over there most of the week.	3
I just don't know why it leaked? We haven't had any problems-could it be hair? Could hair in the pipes cause it?	3
Yeah, I didn't realize. Okay. Is there any way I can get it by Friday? That's two business days?	3
Yeah I would love that but also I- I would appreciate if you could walk me through my options before I make my decision. Then go ahead and add my wife to my policy.	3
you mind breaking down what the comprehensive covers?	3
My neighbor works for Apex. Will he have access to my information?	3
This is exciting! Should I do a drull roll .	3
Do I get, like, a refund for the week left that my daughter won't be on the policy?	3
The other reason I called . Need a house address for the new house! .	3
So when she's an adult she'll get to say if she wants to continue? And she can change who gets the payout if something happens?	3
Would it matter if she has, pre-existing conditions?	3
So I'd have to bring her in for a physical?	3
My friend is always on antibiotics for ear infections? And I'm like, if they worked, then you wouldn't get them anymore.	3
No problem. I think the question was, what was your high school mascot.	3
Yeah, yeah. It's that one. Renter's Basic. I was just wondering, what, like what it covers?	3
Really? You think they'll be okay?	3
Or, like, anything? What are the different things you do?	3
Oh! #Um, I was hoping to speak to Richard.	3
What's a special character? Like a picture?	3
Yeah? Well, what. Is it going to do anything now?	3
Yeah, how's that for a birthday present?	3
Do we get to, like, pick who fixes it?	3
Okay, I'm ready. What's your work's address?	3
Oh, thank god! Yes! Okay. Yeah, that's me totally. Can we kick him off? .	3
Oh, crap. What? What the heck? Why would I even pick that. Can you give me a hint?	3
Hey, hey. I was just faking cause he walked in. Okay. He's in the bathroom. No, I don't have an online account. How do I do that?	3
So, I think, maybe if you could tell me more about the small one?	3
Yes, I understand what it offers. Is there a simpler one?	3
Is this permanent?	3
Like what? Like I say, she doesn't live with us right now. Would she have to move back in, because I don't think thats going to happen.	3
Does it matter that shes not in school anymore? She got through with college and started working, but she doesn't go to college anymore. She thought about going back, but it looks like shes not going to do that for now.	3
Will your daughter be filing a joint tax return this year?	3
And then I need the answer to your security question. What is your mothers maiden name?	3
And when was Gail born?	3
And what what about her health? Does she have any medical conditions you're aware of?	3
Actually now that you mention it, my tooth has been hurting me. What's the deductible on our dental again?	3
Lets hope it's just a filling then.	3
Is it really that high? I mean for a urinary infection?	3
What about getting my insulin?	3
What if I have to have surgery?	3
I'm not entirely comfortable with that. Does it have anything for the insulin?	3
What about the dental. You didn't mention you didn't say anything about that yet.	3
Then you pay for the doctor visit?	3
I'm confused. Is this a religious thing?	3
And what about the other one you mentioned? The simple package.	3
Ah, thats true. What else should I be thinking of?	3
Ok, is it the one at the bottom or the top?	3
Prorated? #Er, what's that mean?	3
Maybe. Does it cover medications?	3
What's that mean?	3
I received a offer for f- for fifteen hundred per year for your complete package. Is this some kind of joke?	3
Uh-huh my #daughter just got married she's changing insurances 	3
Huh seems like you guys cover everything!	3
#Hm, what are my benefits anyways?	3
Uh-huh is there more benefits like that?	3
Could I get your name I'd like to leave a positive review .	3
L.i.c.k.s.t.e.r lickster which one works?	3
Huh what is my CVV?	3
Whew finally done with this company.	3
Oh pretty nice what does PIP stand for?	3
Oh great could you tell me about them if you know anything 	3
Are they the same distance from me?	3
Huh wh-when do you think?	3
#Um why would I want to make it temporary?	3
Oh alright can you do my high school name?	3
Uh-huh what's the city and state you live in?	3
Huh what's PIP?	3
Eee what is comprehensive coverage?	3
Sure can I got referred to this company by my sister.	3
Uh-huh sorry but could you explain those to me?	3
Sorry but what are those?	3
Oh good could you tell me more 	3
Mhm what's PIP?	3
is there a difference between this two proof methods?	3
You have done enough already, oops, how do i get the details of his registration?	3
Can you just walk me through it?	3
there's been a kind of let me just say a situation and it demands that i move from my home to a place closer to my work for accessibility and convenience regarding a new project.	3
Good morning Susan, I'm John William. Calling to get explicit information about your company and her insurance policies and offers as Id love to have an account with you.	3
So the thing is, I'm moving from my current place to a temporary place for a project I was told to head from work.	3
If it passes? What do you mean, If it passes? I just told you how it all happened, and you say if it passes?	3
Yeah, your team will look into it, isn't it?	3
I went to the hospital for check up and I was m..diagnosed of a particular sickness that require urgent financial intervention.	3
Good morning Susan, I'm John William. Calling to get explicit information about your company and her insurance policies and offers as Id love to have an account with you.	3
sorry? what birthday? I am not having birthday today.	3
Is it something i can do now or requires a procedure?	3
Okay, great! I'll go for the Basic Preferred package then. You said it cost how much?	3
So, like, are you saying if I have a guest over and he or she gets injured in my house, this package covers the hospital bills?	3
#Err just to be sure, the Complete Home, sorry I made that mistake again, the Home Complete package, how much does it cost again?	3
Yeah, can I call the CVV now?	3
Could you tell me the first dependent's relationship with you?	3
So you guys have coverage for stuff for stomach things and what not?	3
Why do you need this?	3
Okay I what's term then?	3
What does that mean?	3
Why? What's different about my area? We're literally only like a like a, like twenty minutes from the last place. Like thirty minutes, at the most.	3
Huh? What? Is this a scam-.	3
Oh no- what now? Did my wife get another ticket?	3
What do we have?	3
Alright, I'll tell her that. yeah clubs, volunteer, sports, anything else?	3
Oh yeah I gave it to the robot thing- what I'd even do that for-.	3
Ricky, this is Robert again, tell me what she needs to do.	3
Okay well, we'll have to see about that- You can't just remove them? I mean she's not had any accidents or tickets or anything ever. I mean she's- we've both had a a clean record up until now. Shouldn't we be getting discounts?	3
Jesus! Is that because of that accident she had?	3
Is it gonna take long? Cause I have a doctor's appointment in just a bit. I may have to call back.	3
Well, [clears throat] I'm not sure. How long does it take?	3
Why is that?	3
Does getting your wisdom teeth pulled count? I was under, or, they put me under for that.	3
I need to remove her name.	3
Kind of. So what do I need to do to take her name off the insurance?	3
So, what if I can't get her off the title?	3
Got it. Ok, so if I get her off the title, then I can get her off the policy?	3
Right. Ok. And, what about shots. Does it cover those.	3
Nice. Ok. Um, what else? Um, what about end of life stuff, like if we decide to put her down for whatever reason, does it cover that?	3
Um, so does it cover any over the counter medications, like heart worm medication or anything like that?	3
What about if something happens to her, physically, and she needs like those little wheels on her back legs to get around. Would it cover that?	3
Can't I just give you their name and have you tranfer me?	3
How much are, is the Basic?	3
Yeah. He wants to know if those emergency clinics are covered, too.	3
Hm. Ok. I'm not sure. Is there one with a higher medical?	3
#Oh. Well, how much is the Basic?	3
That's cool. What about, do I have to go through the whole medical review process and all that again?	3
So they didn't take it out of last month's?	3
no I guess not. actually wondering something. If we need to put Peter back on the plan if his job happens to not work out. How would that work?	3
That sounds good. Do I have to meet him at the mechanic's shop?	3
Nice. Which branch?	3
Oh good. I like to see that balance come down. 	4
That's fine. I don't get a partial refund or anything for what I've already paid?	4
Then why does it say I owe four hundred and thirty eight dollars?	4
Hey before you go can you tell me if the next bill coming up will come out of the new bank account?	4
Wait no. Can you tell me when my next bill is due?	4
Well that's too bad. Can you tell me when my bill is due while I have you here?	4
Can you tell me when my next bill is due?	4
Hey yes I mailed my bill about a week ago and I haven't seen it get credited to my account and I just want to check on that.	4
Yeah my name is Ricky Johnson and I'm customer there. I haven't had access to a computer in a while and I need to see when my bill is due and make a payment.	4
Can you tell me when my bill is due?	4
Yeah, my name is Jamie Gresham and I need to see if you got my last payment and ask a question about my coverage.	4
Yeah I need to check my account balance.	4
And when will it come out of my bank?	4
Well while I have you can you tell me when my bill is due?	4
Hey I mailed my check a few days ago to pay you guys and I don't see where it has hit my account. Can you tell me if you see it on your end?	4
Can you tell me when my next bill is due?	4
Great. Will I get any kind of refund? I've already paid my premium this month.	4
Yeah, let me think for a second. Do I want the money back, just to give it to you in three weeks. Or let you keep it for next months billing.	4
How long does it take to get the money refunded?	4
Yes I need to check my account balance with you guys. I don't think I've paid my bill this month so I need to make sure.	4
Does that change the due date at all?	4
Hi I got a notice in the mail saying I was past due. I must have forgot to send you guys a check this month. I need to go ahead and fix that if you can help me please.	4
Great when is the next one due?	4
Great. So who is going to give me my money back for over billing?	4
When is my next bill due so I know to pay it?	4
Yes I need to check the balance on my policy and possibly pay a bill if the payment is due.	4
Hi there I need to see if a payment has been credited to my account.	4
Great! Can you tell me when I'll have to pay again?	4
Yes my name is Margaret Johnson. My customer ID is one three two four five six seven eight, and I sent a check in last week and I haven't seen it get credited to my account.	4
Okay great. Will I get any kind of refund?	4
Awesome and will it just go back to my bank account?	4
I need to check my account balance.	4
Hi Sam I am looking to see where my payment status is at.	4
Okay, could I get any money refunded if it goes into effect sooner?	4
Can you tell me what the balance in my account is?	4
I'm getting ready to buy a house and I want to check everything out before I actually buy.	4
So just ignore the alert if I did already send the payment in?	4
Yeah, I just need to talk to someone about changing my due date on it.	4
Right, good. Yes. Will you send a check? Or?	4
Could you email me a receipt or the confirm number?	4
Alright. #Uh is this how I should pay in the future? Or can I mail a check somewhere?	4
Yeah, yeah, thanks! And I wanted to know if I, like, for example, got the basic, could I maybe add on just the wellness checks? Are there, like, individual pieces, uh, like services that I could add?	4
Okay. So when will my money be refunded?	4
Hi. I just want to check the status of my last payment. I tried checking it on the website but just couldn't figure it out.	4
Hi. I just want to check the status of my last payment. I tried checking it on the website but just couldn't figure it out.	4
Hi there my name is Michael Stockton, and I have an account with you guys, and I was just trying to check how much was left on my bill, but it seems like your system is down.	4
Hi. I just want to check the status of my last payment. I tried checking it on the website but just couldn't figure it out.	4
Okay. So when will my money be refunded?	4
Hi. I just want to check the status of my last payment. I tried checking it on the website but just couldn't figure it out.	4
Sounds easy enough. Do I owe anything today?	4
Oh I bet it was because I didn't have my check in there. so I still owe for this month?	4
Thank you. Am I able to check all of this online?	4
Hello, I would like to check the status of my payment please.	4
OK, when will I know when or if you get my first check?	4
What if it got lost in the mail? I guess I could call my bank to see if they know anything? When will this be past due?	4
OK, maybe I should call the bank and stop the check. I am worried that it got lost in the mail. How else can I pay?	4
Okay. When is that due?	4
Well, I attempted to pay it, but I'm not sure if it went through? It just kept spinning after I clicked submit, and I never got one of those confirmation emails. So is there a way you can check that for me?	4
Damn, okay well how long will this other verification take?	4
I just want to know what my account balance is.	4
When is that due?	4
Ok. When will I have my money back?	4
Hello, my name is Kerry Silver. I need some help. You see I can't remember if I made a payment or what my balance is we have been so busy this month and.	4
Oh, I better write this down. #Um will you email me a receipt?	4
Hi, yes. I was hoping you could tell me what my balance is.	4
When is the next one due?	4
Well we'll see if you take money from me again on the sixteenth. Your not going to just take my money out of the bank anymore, right?	4
Yep, that is how I want them. Did you say I would get a pre-paid envelope to send my check back to you?	4
My last statement that I received in the mail states that my balance due is six hundred and thirty five dollars. That cannot be correct.	4
Ok. So when will I have my money back?	4
Do I get that money back?	4
Well, I've still got the money so, can I pay my balance now?	4
Oh, good! Can you send a receipt for the payment to my email?	4
Yeah, can you help me check the exact amount I owe?	4
No worries. When will I start getting debited?	4
I received a mail that I have an outstanding balance, can you confirm my balance first.	4
Can you help me with the exact balance on the account.	4
Okay so I have no outstanding balance right?	4
Can I get a receipt for the payment then?	4
Hey before you go can you tell me if the next bill coming up will come out of the new bank account?	4
Wait no. Can you tell me when my next bill is due?	4
Well that's too bad. Can you tell me when my bill is due while I have you here?	4
Can you tell me when my next bill is due?	4
Hey yes I mailed my bill about a week ago and I haven't seen it get credited to my account and I just want to check on that.	4
Yeah my name is Ricky Johnson and I'm customer there. I haven't had access to a computer in a while and I need to see when my bill is due and make a payment.	4
Can you tell me when my bill is due?	4
Yeah, my name is Jamie Gresham and I need to see if you got my last payment and ask a question about my coverage.	4
Yeah I need to check my account balance.	4
And when will it come out of my bank?	4
Well while I have you can you tell me when my bill is due?	4
Hey I mailed my check a few days ago to pay you guys and I don't see where it has hit my account. Can you tell me if you see it on your end?	4
Can you tell me when my next bill is due?	4
Great. Will I get any kind of refund? I've already paid my premium this month.	4
Yes I need to check my account balance with you guys. I don't think I've paid my bill this month so I need to make sure.	4
Does that change the due date at all?	4
Hi I got a notice in the mail saying I was past due. I must have forgot to send you guys a check this month. I need to go ahead and fix that if you can help me please.	4
Great when is the next one due?	4
Great. So who is going to give me my money back for over billing?	4
When is my next bill due so I know to pay it?	4
Yes I need to check the balance on my policy and possibly pay a bill if the payment is due.	4
Hi there I need to see if a payment has been credited to my account.	4
Great! Can you tell me when I'll have to pay again?	4
Yes my name is Margaret Johnson. My customer ID is one three two four five six seven eight, and I sent a check in last week and I haven't seen it get credited to my account.	4
Okay great. Will I get any kind of refund?	4
Awesome and will it just go back to my bank account?	4
Oh, wow. You'll need all that? Is there any other way to verify?	4
How do I check?	4
Is there a way I can check online?	4
Okay. And for future reference, can I always check the website to see the status of my payment?	4
Will my payments always send me a receipt of the transaction? So I know it went through?	4
Wonderful. Now, do you need to do the verification thing again?	4
Hi there. #Uh, I just have an account and needed to check my balance?	4
I was just wondering if I could check on my account balance?	4
I'm actually just wondering if there's a balance on my account? I was pretty sure I was supposed to get a bill for the next six months, but I'm afraid I might have missed it?	4
Oh. Yeah, of course. Can I check to see if I have it in my wallet?	4
Awesome. What will you need? Like a voided out check?	4
Hey, great. And will I get like a receipt?	4
Well, can I check if I'm on anything?	4
Ah, that's not bad.Will we be keeping our same due date too?	4
Yep hello h-how do I check my balance I can do it over the phone right?	4
oh lord!!!, how many things do you people need for confirmation... I'm tired of all the questions please.	4
Can my current balance cover it?	4
Oh yeah name is Roger Finley. I don't know my account number though, is it on my billing statement?	4
I'm calling to find out if my payment went through.	4
#Um actually, am I able to just quickly check with you whether the payment on our last bill went through? It was the Renters Preferred package and I just wanted to confirm it had gone through.	4
I need to check my balance.	4
#Oh. No, I was just wondering that if the balance for the rest of the six months wasn't too high, that I would pay it all now.	4
#Oh. So, I can't just pay the balance and have you keep it that way? Wouldn't the system just not bill me if the balance is zero?	4
I better not, will you refund the payment for that?	4
You can't refund me?	4
#Um. I'm calling to see if my payment went through.	4
Right. That's my understanding. So, what is that balance?	4
#Oh great! Why am I getting a refund?	4
Perfect. Is that going to be a check?	4

Yea, I have to go to lunch with the missus. Can he call back this afternoon?	6

But please is there any other way I can do that without calling the help line?	6
Is there a way I can solve this without calling the helpline?	6

Instead of calling the helpline all the time, is there a way I can do other things on my own?	6

Hi, I tried to call but I think I got disconnected?	6

Yes. That sounds like a good idea. How about we do that.	6
#Um, I really am on my way out right now? But is there anyway I could call back later?	6
How about I ask my uncle and give you a quick call back later? Would that work?	6
#Uh, yes, actually. I think I need to update my phone number. I can't remember if I called in the last time I switched phone plans.	6
Will do. Do you have a direct line that I should call?	6
How am I going to keep track of it if I don't call every time?	6

Is it done already?	6
Wait no, you guys also record calls? Is there even any privacy in this country anymore? Why's everyone.	6
yeah, I would like to do that now. But please can I call back and we continue this conversation.	6
Okay, is there a way a can do this without having to call the help line?	6
is there any other way to do this without calling an helpline?	6
Yeah yeah, just one more thing, if for instance I have someone who is interested in opening an account with you, does he have to call you, I mean the r helpline, or are there other ways of doing that like an app or something?	6
My new job has it, but I I heard I need more? Right?	6
Okay, why, well why didn't you do that months ago when I called?	6

Ok. Do I need to call you back, directly, or anyone.	6
Um, how do I do that?	6
Ok. How do I get a hold of you. It's an automatic calling center, right?	6
When do I enter the extension, when I call back?	6
Got it. #Uh, thanks, yeah, I'll look it over. Do I need to call back if I want some?	6
So, what if I get a job again. Can I change back?	6

Yeah will I get anything in the mail or in writing so I know this has been cancelled?	7

Will I get some confirmation letter or email?	7
Yeah, just because I'm on a job can you email it to my wife as well?	7
Yeah, but I don't have a fax machine. Do I have to go somewhere to fax it?	7

Okay. By the way, will my insurance rate go up?	10
What have I got to do next in order to get a proof of insurance?	10
Hi Ann, so my friend just referred Rivertown Insurance to me saying y'all got great customer service because my current insurance company has got really shitty customer service and honestly I'm done with them. Please sign me up I wanna get insured.	10
Great. While that gets generated, can you tell me the difference between life and health insurance?	10
Hi I would like to create an account and also enrol for an insurance plan.	10
I wanna enrol for the life insurance. I could also get an auto quote forwarded to me so I check that out for a later time.	10
And how much for the term life insurance?	10
so what's the difference between the whole life insurance and universal life insurance?	10
Yeah I'd like to set up an account for auto insurance.	10
Whoa. That's way more than I expected it to be. Why is it so expensive? That's kind of outrageous for a basic insurance plan.	10
So I'm looking for the best policy plan with coverage and benefits to suit my needs.	10
Hi Jen, I am trying to learn more information on some insurance plans. [Laughter].	10
No, well, actually, I just bought a new car as well, and want something with a little more coverage. Is there any kind of discount for bundling home and auto insurance?	10
Okay Timothy, let's move back to how to get it paid for with insurance.	10
Yes, I need some proof of insurance for my, car.	10
Glad to hear Timothy. I am going to help you out by buying some more insurance.	10
Yeah I'm at the DMV and I'm trying to register my car but they need proof of insurance so I guess I need you to send me a copy.	10
Yeah I'm trying to register my car and they need my insurance number and I don't have it.	10
I'm actually looking to change my insurance plan for my family and I.	10
Yeah. I'm shopping around for life insurance rates and I wanted to see how you guys compare. I heard a lot of good things about your company from friends.	10
Oh! I need to know how much is left on my car insurance.	10
Okay. Can you tell me the life insurance now?	10
Yeah I have been shopping for car insurance and had saw an ad for you guys and thought I'd see if you could beat the other rates I've got.	10
Hey I currently have life and health insurance with you guys and I recently got a quote for auto insurance that I would like to go ahead and enroll in.	10
Yeah when will I get proof of insurance?	10
Hi yes. My name is Jasmine Glover and I need to get proof of insurance sent to me.	10
What's that, liability insurance?	10
Yeah I got a notice in the mail offering a discount for new policies and I was in the market for new life insurance so I was wondering if maybe I could get some information about that.	10
Well I need to see how much it would cost me to get insurance on my car. My kids say I can't drive it until I have insurance.	10
mhm you mean do I have insurance?	10
Oh hello yes I'm calling I'd like to get my car insured, my 	10
Yes! If I wanted to change my recipienct on the life-insurance. Do I, just call up? Or do I need to come in?	10
Yes, I just bought a new house and I need to get it insured.	10
The report says about twenty percent. Why is it an issue? Every older home in the city has aluminum wiring?	10
Are you serious? So what? People can't get insurance if their house has aluminum wiring? How the hell does that work? You need insurance to get a mortgage?	10
For real? What's wrong wtih Poly B? Jeez. I'm a month away from buying a home and you're telling me that I might not be able to insure it? Who makes up these rules?	10
Okay. So, If I get an inspection on the wiring, and replace the Poly B all within the first thirty days. Can I get insurance?	10
Can you tell me which type of insurance I have right now?	10
No, I'm not. My brother-in-law uses you and he suggested I call. He said the your rates are pretty good. I spoke with Debby last week and I liked the quote I was given. I'd like to proceed with creating an account and setting up the insurance.	10
Yes, is this Rivertown Insurance?	10
Nope. I think actually yeah. I wanted to check on getting some extra life insurance. What are your plans?	10
Yes hi Jeff this is Maria Lopez. I have an auto insurance account with Rivertown and I need to update my payment method.	10
Do they have kind of the same coverage tiers as the auto insurance but with home coverage?	10
Is this going to up my insurance rate?	10
Yeah hi I'm in a bit of a problem right now. I had a problem with my car and they need my insurance.	10
And will insurance take care of any medical bills I need because this wasn't my fault someone ran a stop sign and hit me.	10
Alright. So am I all good insurance wise?	10
No I want to go ahead and keep my term life insurance but add a universal plan since I already paid for the term insurance.	10
Hi yeah I'm a customer with you at Rivertown and I currently get a bill every year for my insurance policy with you but I I don't want that anymore.	10
m what other one do I have I know about the auto insurance.	10
How much is the auto insurance a month?	10
Yes hi my apartment complex wants something saying I have proof of insurance from you all and I also need to change the card I pay the bill with.	10
not really. I just bought a house and need insurance. My friend recommend you guys.	10
Yes hello I called last week to set up a homeowner's insurance policy and made an initial payment but I forgot what the agent said about accessing my account online and I don't remember how much the bill is so I need to see what my current account balance is and also how to access my account online.	10
No I want to go ahead and keep my term life insurance but add a universal plan since I already paid for the term insurance.	10
Just out of curiousity what types of insurance do you offer?	10
And do you have customers that have all of their insurance with you?	10
Okay, right so I've got an automobile policy with you now and I have decided to shop my home insurance.	10
When you call back, I'd like to talk about bundling my car insurance and house insurance.	10

Interesting. Well, can you tell me more about your vehicle coverage? Like, monthly rates, deductible, and discounts and whatnot?	10
Actually, I. #Oh wow, I'm sorry, that was so rude. I just, you just, you reminded me, do you have any special discounts or benefits? Our previous insurance, well, we, I have a son, he just turned nineteen and he got his license maybe what. Three months ago? And we have two cars, I think I maybe. Maybe I said? But anyway. Our insurance offered us discounts because we went so long or, you know. Just, so long without tickets or accidents? And they gave us a small discount on our rates because of course they're a little higher covering our son now because, because he's driving. And there was, I think there was like, maybe a discount because we covered two two vehicles? I'm sorry, I'm totally rambling I just. We want to find the right, the right insurance and company and everything.	10

Hi there I need to change the payment info on my auto pay.	12
Great can I pay over the phone?	12
Yeah I need to cancel automatic payments. You guys have been overcharging me.	12
I am having issues with billing.	12
#Um where is my billing page?	12
So when is my next billing date?	12
Okay au-to-ma-tic billing. Okay done. So yes I'd like to cancel that then please.	12
I don't have any of that actually. I paid the first month on the phone and I haven't received a welcome packet.	12
I hate that I don't have an actual bank account! It makes everything more expensive! I don't understand how you guys can change the price depending on the payment? I'm paying aren't I?	12
Well I have a bit of an issue with my billing.	12
Alright so that's okay then. So now I would like to get set up for automatic billing.	12
Great thanks so much. And when each month will I be charged?	12
Yes, I was billed twice this month, and I need to see what's going on.	12
I just paid my phone bill two days ago and my payment is not reflected in the bill.	12
Wow, if I am not mistaken, that means you charge annually.	12
yes I would like to report a double billing on my account.	12
yes I would like to report a double billing on my account.	12
Yeah, I expected that, is that charge every year?	12
Yeah, I'm calling about a billing error.	12
Right, but that doesn't help when it keeps happening. I want to just be charged the correct amount!	12
Well Josh its not so good. For some reason you took out my payment four days early and for a higher amount and now my bank is overdrawn.	12
You can cancel the automatic pay thing is what you can do.	12
I decided I want to cancel the automatic payments. I just got almost a hundred dollars in overdraft fees.	12
Banks are outragious with fees anymore.	12
Yeah, I will like to rectify my billing and yes I will want to update my billing preference too.	12
Hi, I'd like to report a billing issue. I checked my credit card transaction history and I was billed twice.	12
My name is Terrance Gregory. I want this issue addressed as soon as possible. Why would I be charged twice for a bill I'm supposed to pay for only once.	12
Hi, I'd like to cancel the automatic billing of my account. I tried to cancel it on your website but couldn't. I guess I have to make a phone call to cancel it.	12
I got an email around last week that automatic billings will now include charges as from next month. I don't quite understand that. Please can you explain to me?	12

I would like to set up the recurring billing if you still have time. I'm sorry for all the interruptions.	12
So with the automatic billing, it would come out every month?	12
#Ah Okay. So if I wanted to cancel the automatic billing, I can just call?	12
So the automatic billing will start next month right?	12
yeah I want the automatic payments to stop coming out of my bank! Can you do that for me?	12
Hi, my name is Jane Janeson and I'm having a problem with my billing statement.	12
#Ah yeah I'm having issues with my billing and need to get the automatic payments turned off.	12
Yeah, I just want to get rid of the automatic payments.	12
No no no, I want it off off. I keep getting overcharged because I can't get see my bill until the automatic payment already goes. I just want it turned off and get regular statements in the mail.	12

Hi Jason. My name is Miranda and I am having an issue with automatic billing.	12
So I would like to change my automatic billing.	12
Hi yeah I need to change how I'm billed.	12
Hi I am looking to update my billing preferance.	12
But I got a letter in the mail from Rivertown saying my payment didn't go through, and I was like, why? I sent the money!	12
#Um, I need to change it so that I'm not billed automatically.	12
Okay. I don't think I was due to be billed anytime soon though, was I?	12
Ok! if that is true, why was my bank account debited for more than I was told?	12
I did not agree to this charge and I want it removed!	12
#Um, I made a payment for my plan, but I just received a mail that I owe.	12
Well, I noticed that I do not get the invoice for my monthly payment, and I was wondering why that is so.	12
Is that why I haven't been getting the invoices?	12
Can I update my billing frequency then?	12
#Err will I be charged for this update?	12
Hi there I need to change the payment info on my auto pay.	12
Hi. I wanna stop my automatic payments.	12
I wanna stop my auto payments.	12
Hi, Natalie. I want to cancel my automatic billing.	12
Oh. Well I'll talk to him about that. So am I going to be back-charged for those other months?	12
Great can I pay over the phone?	12
Yeah I need to cancel automatic payments. You guys have been overcharging me.	12
My wife was wanting to ask, is it possible to change our billing frequency?	12
Yes, I don't know what all that means, I just need to change this-this, internet billing.	12
Yes, that looks like the address we have on file for you. Will that be the best billing address as well?	12
Ive been charged twice for last months service. So I want to cancel automatic billing and just do it by hand.	12
Right exactly. But I want you to fix my over charge first.	12
I did say that, but first I want you to look at the over charge. Your system billed me twice last month instead of once.	12
So about cancelling that the automatic billing thing?	12
Do you want to permanently cancel your auto-billing?	12
I'm sorry you're not satisfied with what you're getting. Would you like to bundle your TV, Internet and phone? It's a substantial discount from what you would pay for them separately. And it may be better than the deal you're getting right now with your phone provider. I see we don't provide phone for you.	12
I can just imagine what the charge is for that a month. What do you charge for.	12
Hi Adam, I need to remove the automatic payment thing from my account.	12
Yeah, can we take that payment thing off?	12
Oh alright go ahead and charge me right now.	12
Whoa that's wonderful will I be charged today?	12
Thank you Amy, so next month on the fourth I'll be charged again?	12
I am actually having an issue with a transaction going on in my account.	12
Well I was looking at my credit card statement last night. And I think I might have been double billed for my policy this past month? Can you check that for me?	12
I got a deduction from my balance concerning a plan but I didn't initiate the payment and this deduction has actually ruined my plans.	12
How do you guys charge my account?	12
are there any other billing frequency as you called it?	12
Hi, my name is Maybelle Clearmont, I need to change my billing cycle.	12
So wait, you're going to charge me based on my address.	12
Yeah, I got this email that said I need to pay my bill and then when I logged in I saw that my automatic payments were, had stopped or been changed and I don't know why, then I thought I made a payment, but didn't get an email saying I made it.	12
Look I'm just a little skeptical of handling these things through the website, is there any way you can help me find the problem with my recent payment on the phone now? Could you remind me which account its been charged out of?	12
#Um I think for today it would be great if I could actually pay the August bill over the phone with you now, out of my checking account if possible because I know that will work. Do you take over the phone payment for bills?	12
Ok. Now lets see I have your account open and right now it is set to mail your bill to your address on the fist of each month. What would be your preference for billing?	12
Well, I got this email that says, well I get my payments, are made, they're automatic and I noticed the payment was higher than usualy, so I went online, and saw a weird charge.	12
Hello. I want to change to automatic billing.	12
Hi. I want to cancel my automatic payments.	12

And what do I lose in coverage?	15
that's a lot less. What does it cover?	15
What do they cover?	15
Okay, that sounds better. You said there was three levels? What is the highest level of coverage?	15
good question, I thought once she was out of university her coverage ended right away? Do I have options there?	15
m how much more coverage.	15
Well m I don't think I need that much coverage probably do I? What do you think?	15
#wow okay well I'd definitely like more coverage than that.	15
Wow, that's more that I thought it would be, but I guess it's worth it. What does that cover?	15
Ouch. What does that cover?	15
What does that cover?	15
Yeah, I guess that would change things. #Uh what does it not cover?	15
Then will the, our new coverage start?	15
Oh, OK. So what does it cover?	15
Would it cover electronics because James has a pile of those devices?	15
Is that all it will cover?	15
Do both cover the same stuff?	15
Um what does each one cover?	15
Does that show the coverage amount?	15
Ok. Is there anything it does not cover?	15
She's covered I think that's all I need. Oh, how long until I get proof of her coverage?	15
Ok, what is the coverage for that?	15
Mhm, is there anything a little cheaper than that? I think my wife was wanting me to reduce our coverage.	15
Mhm, is there anything a little cheaper than that? I think my wife was wanting me to reduce our coverage.	15

Oh doesn't sound too bad could you get more specific with the coverages?	15
Uh-huh what are the required coverages?	15
Oh could you tell me about the coverages?	15
Well, what does it even you know, cover?	15
What are the coverages for those?	15
Ok, so, uh, what does that cover?	15
And how much coverage for that?	15
[sounds of typing] And, while I'm doing this, how much coverage, what's the coverage?	15
None of my info has changed, so, fifteen hundred and two thousand. Ok. So, what are the coverages for each?	15
Yes please. Could you please sign me up?	16
Yes please sign me up.	16
Got it. How soon should I expect to be contacted by this adjuster so I free up my schedule?	16
Okay. Sign me up.	16
Okay then. Sign me up.	16
you know what I think Ill just do the basic for both and if I feel like I need to change it later, can I just call you guys, and have it switched?	16
Yes I do. Is there any other way to do this? I need to get back to work and this is taking too long.	16
Yes if I need to make any changes like this in the future can I do it online?	16
No. Do you think I'd take the time to memorize that?	16
Yes it does. I do have a few other places I want to check. Is it okay if I get back to you?	16
Yes and update my phone number too.	16
Yes is there another way to change these other than calling in?	16
No not at the moment I want to talk to my husband about it and see what he thinks.	16
Yes I've heard a lot of good things about you guys from friends and family and I was interested in finding a local agent to talk about signing up for one of your plans.	16
#Uh no, not yet I don't think. I want to discuss the plans with my husband first.	16
Do I have to sign anything?	16
Yeah you are true. Hmm I I think I would like to sign Garfield up for that.	16
Yikes, yeah, vaguely. I always say I'm going to write those down. Let's hope I remember, do I have to remember all three?	16
What can you change in there?	16
#Uh, could we actually change that to something else?	16
Yeah, where would I find that on your website. I want to jot that down for future reference. Save myself a bit of time. .	16
That's right. Will that change anything?	16
No, thank you so much, what was your name again?	16
And if I want to change it later can I?	16
Can I downgrade as well?	16
No, I'm selling my house and moving to abroad.	16
Yes hello Cassie I called last week to enquire about well here's the thing I'm going through a divorce.	16
I sure hope so because I'm getting charged a lot more than I should be and my address is slightly wrong as well. Luckily I got the bill though.	16
Oh yeah I actually need to update that with you as well.	16
Well that won't work will it if you have my wrong address.	16
No. But will I get confirmation of that?	16
I just moved and I tried to do it online but it didn't work and so I'm hoping to get this resolved now.	16
I would be glad if I can have it as soon as possible.	16
No. I'm at work. Can you look it up another way?	16
If you're saying it can be downgraded after I talk with Wendy to confirm everything, then, yes, I guess.	16
I would be glad if I can have it as soon as possible.	16
All right. All right. Go ahead and email me a link and I'll do it on my own.	16
No problem, I can wait. Do you know when the adjuster will be by?	16
Nope. That was it, I just needed to change my address, and phone number I guess. .	16
Yes. do capital letters matter?	16
I will. You guys should switch to that text me thing, with a code, or an authentication generator. Something more modern.	16
Nah, I think that's that's it my dear. And what's your name again?	16
Yes. I would appreciate it if you would send it to me immediately.	16
Well, will I get a call about the, adjuster?	16
Wouldn't tech support have figured that out?	16
Wow, no, I didn't know it had that one. I haven't used it in a long time. Can I change it?	16
I need to, unless you can give me a discount.	16
And how long will that take? To process this change.	16
#Uh, oh, no, no! It was just, time for an upgrade.	16
OK, so what do I need to.	16
Cool! So how, I mean, when should I, get her signed up?	16
Yeah, yeah. Should I mail it.	16
Yeah, Yeah. So, could you tell me how ba- how bad it will be?	16
Is twenty seventeen, like, old?	16
How did you discover that startup security firm?	16
Do I go ahead and hire someone?	16
#huh That sounds pretty good, what about the second option.	16
Finally. Please add a dependent to my account.	16
You're welcome. I think you need to upgrade your app.	16

Yes, can I proceed with the expiration date?	16

Not yet. I was hoping to talk to an agent in the area first.	16
#Um no, I don't think so. Where would that be?	16
That would be great! I'm starting to think there might be something wrong with my internet.	16
What do I do after I sign and date it?	16
I'd like to try to Sorry, hang on. #Um I was trying to change my package, if that's possible?	16
Oh no, seriously? I didn't want to have to change everything. Can you tell me what, how... When did this change?	16
Ok, yeah. Let's go ahead and upgrade it then.	16
No, unless you want to renew my registration for me. .	16
Oh, that's awesome. Okay. I think that's what I'll do then. Please, send me the link to the website.	16
This makes absolutely no sense. I want to speak to a manager please.	16
Great, thanks. Oh I need to update my phone number too cause that changed too.	16
Yes did we get this resolved, because I have bills to pay.	16
Oh I wondered if you can do this online if I want to change it in the future?	16
Yes, we did. Will the adjuster need a copy?	16
Yes, I definitely need to speak to a supervisor. This is is craziness thing I have ever heard!	16
So what do you advice now.	16
Can't you just look that up from your system.	16
So, where in my email do you think it would be? I'm not seeing it here.	16
So, where in my email do you think it would be? I'm not seeing it here.	16
Nope, I don't think so. Do you have any plans for the rest of the day?	16
No, but it is almost five do they let you off early before the weekend?	16
What if I pick the fifteen years but I outlive it! .	16
Oh, no. No. I really don't have time for all that. I just wanted to know what happens if the term ends and I'm still kickin' .	16
Yes if I need to make any changes like this in the future can I do it online?	16
No. Do you think I'd take the time to memorize that?	16
Yes it does. I do have a few other places I want to check. Is it okay if I get back to you?	16
Yes and update my phone number too.	16
Yes is there another way to change these other than calling in?	16
No not at the moment I want to talk to my husband about it and see what he thinks.	16
That's true. Let me think about it and can I reach back out or do this online?	16
Yes I've heard a lot of good things about you guys from friends and family and I was interested in finding a local agent to talk about signing up for one of your plans.	16
I think so . #Um, just out of curiosity, are you guys hiring right now?	16
No, but seriously. How lucky is it that I'd get you again?	16
And will they be able to tell me how quickly this all will be resolved?	16
#Um, could I think about it? Like maybe send me something about it that I could, read or something?	16
Yeah, so can we look it up another way?	16
Yeah. And it renews in September?	16
#Uh, yes, I'm having some problems that need to be fixed today.	16
Yes. Is this the supervisor?	16
Did we get everything fixed? No more autobilling?	16
So, so will it be. #Um, is there any way to -.	16
Can I change it now?	16
What if I change my mind?	16
Yes, thats fine. We can get you checked in another way. What's your phone number?	16
I see what you mean. I still don't feel good about it, but I want to get that mailing changed.	16
Yeah, that needs to change to my new house.	16
Then I think I'd like to change it online, I think.	16
Yeh, it does. But why wouldn't they tell us this?	16
Yeh, but who reads those?	16
#Huh? No, no, no, I don't have time and my head hurts too much to learn all that rigamarole right now. Which reminds me, you don't by any chance have some water, do you?	16
Correct. It's Polish. Do you gys have to memorize those spellings?	16
Yep can I change it online too?	16
Huh no I don't think so today maybe later this week I just wanted to set up the account today.	16
Whew I guess make it temporary, but m how long could I change it for?	16
Uh-huh I got that how is Flynn spelled?	16
#Uh I actually couldn't find it but is there another way to 	16
Oh yes I guess can I only change it through the phone?	16
I wanted to sign up my daughter under my plan through my dashboard yesterday.	16
Okay, what's the next information.	16

Okay, what's the way out of this.	16
I think I found it. It's enabled. Can you disable it already?	16
All I want is for it to be disabled.	16
Y-yeah yeah, I mean no, my day's not going great. I'm calling to report an accident.	16
But I didn't move like it's. Well whatever did anything change?	16
Oh no I need to change it to something my wife will know too cause she has to login too.	16
Ok. So, there's an expiration date for the Term?	16
#Um, before we start, can, I change to Term is for some reason if I don't want Universal? Or, even Whole for that matter?	16
Ok, can you help me with it.	16
Just tell me when the adjuster will be there and I'll give them a call. They have a key.	16
Will they have to stay there while the adjuster is there?	16
Ok. Do you take Visa?	16
No, no you don't! You sound way too young to have children! Do you even have children?	16
Ok. Where on your site.	16
And, after ten years?	16
Well, I don't like this. I want to submit a complaint.	16
Do I need to give the adjuster anything when they get here?	16
No, I think that, well actually, how long after the adjuster does his thing before I get a check?	16
No. Thank you. #Uh what are your hours if I call back.	16
I'm looking at enrolling for an auto and health plan.	17
Well I think I want the Basic Auto, but can you tell me the difference between Basic and the next one up? I don't really understand the difference.	17
Oh! I need to pay my bill and ask a question about auto-pay.	17
Hey I'm working with a local agent and they said I need to call and set up an account so I can finish purchasing my new auto plan.	17
No. It's my fault for not being more prepared. Would-would the policy number be on my email receipt of autopay?	17
Great. So I want to sign up for the preferred plan then please.	17
And if I decide to change to the basic plan will I get a refund?	17
Oh nice thanks. And am I able to sign up for auto pay and paperless billing and all that good stuff?	17
Okay great. Yeah I have a basic automobile plan and I want to change it to a higher plan.	17
Yeah let me change to paperless billing and can I also sign up for that auto payment thing too?	17
Is it possible to set up auto pay?	17
Oh okay that's good then. Can I do the auto pay thing?	17
Oh that's good. Excellent. Okay so yeah sorry. I think I called Rivertown last week inquiring about an auto plan and I'd like to enroll in one.	17
Auto what?	17
I know I can't afford a complete plan, so just tell me the difference between a basic plan and a preferred one.	17
Okay. So then what is the Complete Auto Plan?	17
Yes. So let's sign me up for the Complete Auto Plan.	17
Okay. Will it be permanent? Or can I switch back to autopay later?	17
I will like to switch to the basic auto.	17
Okay. is it preferred Auto or complete auto? I'm not quite sure. Please can you give me a moment?	17
Okay. is it preferred Auto or complete auto? I'm not quite sure. Please can you give me a moment?	17
How's that one different from the Basic Auto?	17
And you think I should go with the standard one? Basic Auto?	17
Okay then, yep. I want to sign up for the standard plan.	17
I will like to switch to the basic auto.	17
I am calling to cancel my autopay because you all billed me twice in the same month!	17
I just want to get the autopay turned off to avoid this hassle in the future.	17
Yes, that is correct. I would like to change from my checking account to my credit card for my autopay.	17
Will this still be an autopay?	17
Oh, thank you. Is there a way to set up autopay?	17
Since I am going to once per month that might be a good idea. What information do you need for autopay?	17
ok, i would like to switch to the basic auto plan.	17
i said I'll like to switch from the preferred auto plan to the basic auto plan.	17
Yh, I'm working on something and i need all the little money i can get thats why I'm switching the basic auto plan.	17
Hi, I was calling cuz I needed to pay my bill. I bounced my auto pay, or whatever you call that to autopay.	17
Well what would happen if I just canceled my autopay altogether and just called it in every month?	17
Oh! I need to pay my bill and ask a question about auto-pay.	17
Hey I'm working with a local agent and they said I need to call and set up an account so I can finish purchasing my new auto plan.	17
Hello? I just needed to-to cancel autopay?	17
I just can't afford to get my credit dinged. I'm cancelling all my autopay billing options. Like everything, not just insurance.	17
#Um, yeah. Hi. I was looking to start up auto-pay?	17
Hi. My name i- is Carson. I just bought a car from Frank Brown Used Auto on highway eight in Crystal Falls. He hooked me up with new pol- policy with you guys. Now I need to create an account to take advantage of an a paperless billing promo or something like that. He said it was ten bucks off each month for signing up. I don't need to get paper.	17
#Ah ok, and are are any there restrictions on the Basic Auto plan?	17
Actually, I just need to understand the plans available under the automobile package and how they work, although, basically, based on what the agent sort of explained, I had it in mind to go with the Basic package, but I think if I know how the rest work properly, I will be confident on which to go for, you know?	17
#Uh okay, so is it just those two plans because I feel like the other agent mentioned something like Auto Comprehensive or is it the Comprehensive Auto now?	17
Yeah I thought I set it up oh no I didn't that was my car insurance okay nevermind don't cancel it but can you set up autopay now.	17
I need to change my plan, auto plan.	17

Well I just got a new cat and I'm thinking about getting her insured. Can I do that?	20
Hi. I wanna make enquiries about your pet policies and perhaps get my pet insured.	20
Can I get a quote for the petcare preferred plan.	20
Hi, Mike. Um, I need insurance for my dog.	20
Well, I talked to the vet and he recommends your bigger planwhat's it called? Is it premiere?	20
Gabe, hi, my name is Sam. I need to, uh, find out how much it costs to get insurance for my dog.	20
Hey I got several policies with you guys but I saw online that you offer pet insurance. Can you tell me how much that costs?	20
How about my favorite pet's name?	20
Do they both cover emergency vet visits?	20
Anyway I am looking to get some pet insurance, but I am looking around and have a few questions then want to figure out the total.	20
Is that the Dog lover email you have?	20
Yes I am and I actually just got a new pet so I'll need two policies I guess.	20
And how much would the add-on be for the second pet?	20
yeah, I had a few questions about a Petcare basic policy. You offer that right?	20
Well, I'm thinking I'd like to get some coverage for my pets today. You do carry pet insurance, right?	20
Right, just needs her regular kitten shots and examiss I'll probably want to have her teeth cleaned and claws clipped regularly as she gets older, too. Does your plan cover that?	20
Could you send some information about your pet insurance policy to my email.	20
yeah, I had a few questions about a Petcare policy. You offer that right?	20
yeah, I had a few questions about a Petcare policy. You offer that right?	20
Could you send some information about your pet insurance policy to my email.	20
Could you send some information about your pet insurance policy to my email.	20
yeah, I had a few questions about a Petcare advance policy. You offer that right?	20
Could you send some information about your pet insurance policy to my email.	20
I have a bit of an unusual question. I I'm w-wondering whether I can insure my rabbit?	20
OK, got it. So would they, like, get insurance cards? I've never even, well I guess I don't go to vets very often. I mean I guess I will now, but I've never heard them even ask about insurance.	20
OK, yeah. Makes sense. And can I also, could I, like, change coverage at some point, if it seems like, I dunno, like Pookie is super-healthy and like never needs to see the vet? Would it be, like, easy to change that?	20
#Uh, oh, no! Sorry, I wasn't clear. No, it's- I wanted some, information on your pet insurance policies. And information on packaging, or bundling.	20

And what kinds of deaths do these policies cover?	23
And so, like, when we do this, we'll need to like cancel our old policy, but like will we be covered the whole time? Or, like, will there be a gap?	23
Hi! I've got an auto policy with you and I'd, I'd like to add my daughter.	23

Actually, I'm also calling because our homeowner's policy with Lakeview is expiring and we wanted to transfer it establish a new policy with you.	23
So there's I guess minimal damage to our car, a bit more to the other, and I'm also kinda worried about the damage to our policy. Our premium. It'll go up, right? And, stay on our file?	23

Yes, we did do that. Is that money is it lost when we cancel the policy or is there like, some sort of refund?	23
Right, right. What's what would be considered normal? Or what's a good like, a good policy usually last?	23
#Oh, wow. Okay, that's good to know, thank you. And are those policies much better than than this one?	23
Wow. Okay. #Um. Well I think that a ten year policy might be good. Can I cancel this, if something ? If for whatever reason I?	23

Good morning! I just needed to add a person to my policy?	23

Well, now that we have the difference in price down, how about you fill me in on what the difference is on the policies?	23

Hi, David, my name is Marvin Wisniewski, and I need to get my policy number.	23
I need to add my sixteen year-old to my policy, unfortunately. 	23
Well I would like to add another car to my policy.	23
Yes I'd like to cancel my policy.	23
I received a notice that my policy that policy was going to lapse but I don't think that's right.	23
Hey can you tell me when my policy expires too when it's up for renewal.	23
Hi. I can't find my policy number and need it for my bank.	23
Ok. Thanks. What about the proof that I have the policy?	23
Can you email me the policy info?	23
Yeah. Did you send the policy info to my email?	23
Ok. I was hoping they could refund me.	23
Hi. I'm call to add my son to my auto policy.	23
Are there any extra fees that I'm going to be surprised with if I enroll?	24
That's how much in premiums montly?	24
Yeah, alright. So it says I paid late. What does that have to do with this bill?	24
Is that because your customers, prefer it? Sure, let's hear it.	24
I, I think I've got it. So, after that first visit, if the total cost, spread out over, three years, and it was, say, four thousand dollars, you guys would cover the first two thousand each year.	24
Thanks. Hey I've always wondered. Do I get any kind of discount for using automatic payments?	24
Can I ask you what this will do to my premium?	24
Can you also tell me what that does to my premium?	24
Okay the due date is tomorrow, I won't receive a late fee will I?	24
Are there any additional fees for that?	24
Yes. What is the payment difference? Is there a convenience fee or anything?	24
Yes. I need to do something about lowering my premiumiss I recently lost my job and just can't afford the payments anymore. I don't want to change companies. I've been with you guys for years.	24
Are there any fees for that?	24
And that includes the fee?	24
Oh no. I did forget. Did I get a late fee?	24
Perfect. Thank you. Will there be an increase in the premium?	24
Yeah do I get any discounts for paying annually compared to if I broke it up into installments?	24
And are there any extra charges for paying monthly?	24
Is there an extra charge?	24
Okay. Will I get any late fees because of this?	24
Oh, okay. You said a lower level. So there's a limit that you'd pay out for that?	24
Yikes. That doesn't sound like much. What's the next level?	24
Okay, that's good. Would my premium go up the next year if I submitted a claim?	24
Yes my name is John and I've been a customer a while with you guys. I was wondering if I get any discounts from changing my bill from monthly to yearly?	24
Ok. I suppose that one will be fine. What is the monthly premium on that?	24
That still sounds ridiculous. How much longer am I paying this for?	24
I'm just wondering, will that reduce our premium? With Jill dropping off the plan?	24
Am I going to get charged a late fee?	24
You could give me half off my rate for six months? What's the catch?	24
The problem is that this is only a temporary rate right?	24
Yes, and I just want a really good rate. That makes all the difference. What rate you'll get.	24
And what's the price for the premium plan? Is that the name?	24
That totally sucks. How much will it go up?	24
Yeah yeah no absolutely. So okay you said the preferred in how much?	24
Alright is there any way to eliminate the late fee from last month? My mom was admitted to the hospital and has not been in the right frame of mind.	24
Do you all offer that?	24
Yes, what's the premium on that again? I think I saw it on your website, but can't quite remember.	24
Can the premiums be paid monthly?	24
no, but thank you for the reminder because I am going to have to send you all a check this time because my debit card expired and the new one hasn't came. I don't know how long it will take to get to you but I am going to drop it by the post office on my way to work in the morning. I don't trust the kids in my neighborhood not to mess with it. So will I be charged a late fee? Or what is the penalty for being late?	24
Can you tell me how much my premiums will change, you know, monthly?	24
And you say I get a ten percent discount for doing this?	24
But what if I don't need all that? I don't have an extra four hundred dollars laying around.	24
Good student discount? Uh, what's a good student discount get me?	24
Oh, I didn't know that. Are there other discounts available?	24
So, lets say, I lost everything, would I get the full amount?	24
Fifty dollars? Sorry, what cooling off period?	24
Okay. What are the different plans you have and is there a discount for bundling accounts?	24
Will you get credit for it, if I do it.	24
No ma'am. I'm just looking around for the best rate.	24
#Uh, sorry, does it matter how we pay? Like is it more expensive to like pay online versus sending a check or something?	24
OK, And if I speed? Do I get, like, penalized or something? Like, do my rates go up?	24
And if I lose the speeding, or not speeding discount?	24
no, no, I think I'm good. So yeah, we're gonna go with the preferred for both of them. And can I submit my payment online? I already do that for the auto. Can I do it for the kitties too?	24
And so even if I get both, are there, like, different amounts? Like I pay more for higher coverage? Or I maybe pay less at first but then, like, I have to pay more for, like, repairs or something?	24
And are there any, like, good driver discounts while I'm driving? I mean, like, if I keep my record clean, are there any discounts? Like for no speeding tickets or distracted driving or anything?	24
OK. But, like, what happens if I like do go over ten thousand? Like if I have more stuff than that, and then something happens?	24
If not, how do we pay?	24
Hm, well ya know I'm payin like forty six now for all but I don't have all that up sell on the life. Are there discounts for paying in full or quarterly?	24
Kindly provide me the fee and the method of paying.	24
What options are there? I really wouldn't want to spend more than five hundred a year.	24
And my plan started on I guess my question is do you guys do retroactive discounts?	24
This new customer sign on discount, and I was wondering if I qualified for it?	24
That is correct, do you know what that discount would be on my account? You said ten percent.	24
Oh, I didn't realize why exacty do I not qualify for the discount anymore?	24
How are my rates affected at fault?	24
Are there any more surprise fees coming? Any other surprises coming down?	24
Kindly provide me the fee and the method of paying.	24
Is there an additional fee for paying by credit card?	24
Great. So as long as I pay before the seventh then my payment will not be late?	24
So my rate will not go up if I go to monthly?	24
Today is the due date, I won't be charged a late fee will I?	24
This won't cause a premium change, will it?	24
Yeah, I do want to file a claim no reason why we can't do it now. But his company has to pay, right? Like, my premium shouldn't go up or.	24
Without the double fee thing?	24
As a result of the promotion I'm to move to a new city.	24
Well I was charged twice this month for my premiums and I am not happy about this.	24
Okay. Are there any additional fees or is it just the fifteen hundred or whatever it is with the discount?	24
How much would that fee be?	24
Ok. Yeah I would like to avoid the fee if possible.	24
#Uh, yeah. I'll do that. I'd also like to make it my preferred method of pay.	24
What fees??? I was not told about any fees!	24
THIRTY DOLLARS! I was not told about no document fee! Just cancel the policy. I knew it was a scam!	24
And will I be charged for a late payment fee?	24
That sounds great! Getting rid of all the extra baggage at once.	24
Hm I am not sure if I want to pay that, can't you just waive that fee.	24
Thanks. Hey I've always wondered. Do I get any kind of discount for using automatic payments?	24
Can I ask you what this will do to my premium?	24
Can you also tell me what that does to my premium?	24
Okay the due date is tomorrow, I won't receive a late fee will I?	24
Are there any additional fees for that?	24
Yes. What is the payment difference? Is there a convenience fee or anything?	24
Then it's not a real bonus or raise .	24
Yes. I need to do something about lowering my premiumiss I recently lost my job and just can't afford the payments anymore. I don't want to change companies. I've been with you guys for years.	24
Are there any fees for that?	24
And that includes the fee?	24
Oh no. I did forget. Did I get a late fee?	24
Yeah do I get any discounts for paying annually compared to if I broke it up into installments?	24
And are there any extra charges for paying monthly?	24
Is there an extra charge?	24
Okay. Will I get any late fees because of this?	24
Yes my name is John and I've been a customer a while with you guys. I was wondering if I get any discounts from changing my bill from monthly to yearly?	24
We just received a text saying, we're late? We're late paying our bill?	24
Do you get a discount for online payment?	24
So how much will I save?	24
Well, I hope not, but who knows with this crazy dog. Do you have to pay the premium all at once?	24
Oh, yeah. I'll keep that in mind. What else do you offer?	24
The twenty-fifth? That's like, in three days? You'll still charge me seventy five dollars for a three days difference?	24
Yeah. And there's this monthly fee, too.	24
If it automatically bills, how can I be late? How can I be late? You tell me, how can I be late?	24
Good. And no late fee?	24
Yes. #Uh, what are my options as far as paying?	24
Does that make it any cheaper than paying every month?	24
Well, what exactly makes the premium, premium then?	24
Is there a difference of how much you pay out?	24
Yes, but I- I'm supposed to get some kind of like discount for doing it. Right?	24
Well, wait so you're gonna take my info then tell me I don't get the the dis- discount?	24
Huh well what's faster.	24
Huh how much does that save me?	24
Nah that's why I'm calling I saw that it said y-you guys have great rates is that true?	24
Huh how much is it the fee.	24
#Um yes, but what was the rate again?	24
Uh-huh yes I would like to but do I have to pay it all at once?	24
Awesome. OK should I be worried this will happen again? Like now I am kind of worried about it and I don't want to have to worry you know about this kind of stuff.	24
Yeah let's go ahead and pay it.	24
#Mhm. Well, when I logged in, because I wanted to check to see what my monthly payment was because I'm making a budget. A budget for the first time ever because I'm trying to save money to take a trip to Europe next summer with my besties.	24
#Yep. We've been saving for over a year and I wanted to see if I could save more by doing a budget. You know, but we already have tickets.	24
So, how much is the late fee?	24
Sounds good. It won't be the full amount today, right?	24
Ok. How much more of a discount?	24
#Um, will it save me five percent today?	24
Good. Ok. So, this month, even though the payment didn't go through, I won't get a late fee?	24
Got it. So, I won't get a late fee?	24
Does it matter if I do monthly, is there a discount for monthly?	24
Yes, well, for now, I just want my lodging to be paid for.	24
Yes, but I was wondering if you could do it cheaper than the company I have.	24

Great. Can I go ahead and pay that now?	26
I got you. can I pay online that way too?	26
And I have to pay that now?	26
That's fine what payment methods do you guys accept?	26
When will the next payment be due?	26
Great when is my next payment due?	26
Okay. How can I pay?	26
Okay can I pay this online? I've never tried.	26

Great. So this month's payment isn't going to come out automatically?	26
Okay great. Can I go ahead and pay that?	26
What do you accept for payment?	26

Oh, yeah. I just have a weird thing going on with my paychecks and bills? I'll get it all figured out, I just want to make sure the payment goes through like today or tomorrow.	26

Yes, but you guys got my money twice. If you got paid why did you get paid again?	26
How will they pay me?	26
But fees. Do the payments go up? Or I know there is some kind of penalty for something like that.	26
Hi, James. I need to change my payment preference and change my security questions.	26
With the bank account change, will my payment date remain the same?	26
#Uh since the month's already started what happens with my next payment?	26
Oh okay. Can you give me an estimate for my next payment then?	26
Okay, good to know. #Uh does my payment date change or anything?	26
how soon can I make a payment?	26
OK. And what is the, the amount, sorry, I don't remember what it's called, but, like, the amount that I have to pay first?	26
Is that, like, where I make payments and stuff?	26
No I haven't but I'm gonna need to later on cause will I be able to make payments online as well?	26
I think that's all, so my monthly payment, will it come out automatically?	26
Timmy it might sound like a stupid question, but how do I get the money? It has not magically shown up in the bank account. I was hoping to.	26
Is that what I am paying, Timothy?	26
That's affordable. How does payment go, and what is liability protection?	26
I am telling you right now that I did not change my payment date. And what about the extra forty bucks you been charging?	26
So how do I update my payment preference.	26
Yes, how do I make payment?	26
Does that mean my payments will get a lot lower?	26
Well, would I just pay the first payment today?	26
Yes, how do I make payment?	26
How will I go about the payment process?	26
Uh, our payment or how much is the loan for?	26

Yes alright, okay well, I need to update my payment preference.	26
Wow, Would we pay just like we are now?	26
Yes, okay. What is the total upfront cost if I payed today?	26
Wait, is that one month? I thought my payments were less than that.	26
I have never heard of this kind of nonsense in my life! What kind of business would make it's customers send proof of payments?	26

Yeah that's right. I need to pay for this past month I think it's due in like two days or something.	26
Hi Sandy, yeah this Mike Harlow. I need to change my payment option please.	26
when will my first payment be?	26
Yeah when will my payments come out?	26
Oh, yeah do I need to pay today?	26
Cool. So about how long until I get the money?	26
Will the amount I pay go up if, the economy goes down?	26
Thank you! Do you know how long it'll take to get the payment from my account?	26
Can I pay that now?	26
Ok. So how do I get the money? I am listed as the beneficiary, right?	26
Well and how long do you think it will take for you to receive the cheque.	26
#Er and how many days past my payment days is it now?	26
Have you done the payment now?	26
So it only pays if I pass within that time frame, correct?	26
No that's okay I can pay it online right?	26
Yes is there any other way to pay this other than mailing a check?	26
When will I be able to see what my monthly payments are?	26
Great. Can I go ahead and pay that now?	26
I got you. can I pay online that way too?	26
And I have to pay that now?	26
That's fine what payment methods do you guys accept?	26
When will the next payment be due?	26
Great when is my next payment due?	26
No. All I needed was to stop the automatic payments. Everything else is fine.	26
Okay. How can I pay?	26
Okay can I pay this online? I've never tried.	26
Oh oh oh okay I see. I understand now. I think you are right! Maybe I did change that a few months ago. But, why did it just now change my payment?	26
So you put my payments back to where they was before I changed them the last time I was online..	26
Hi, Holly. I'm Melissa Stimson and I want to change the way I pay automatically.	26
Great. So this month's payment isn't going to come out automatically?	26
Okay great. Can I go ahead and pay that?	26
What do you accept for payment?	26
Yeah, that too. Okay. #Uh, and you need a credit card?	26
Oh, yeah. My wife says we got another question. I need to know what our payment is.	26
I don't know what it's called! But it doesn't always make the payment.	26
#Uh, no? I just needed to change my payment preference.	26
So Angela, I was wondering if there was a different way to pay?	26
In person to set up an online payment? I never had someone ask that before.	26
That you last paid January second. You're current on your payments.	26
Okay. So, what do you need for me to pay for now?	26
And I just want to pay this months bill. Not that continuing basis like you were saying.	26
I mean if I pay for six months in advance.	26
Actually, you know what? I think I have a payment due.	26
Oh, ok, I I think I will wait then until Ron's pay comes next week I will call back with that and talk to you then,. Ron wants me to set up automatic payments but they just make me too nervous.	26
Yeah, will my payment still be due on the tenth?	26
Right, right then I should send it in early or I could just come to the office and pay #huh?	26
#Ah, yeah yeah but you won't mark me paid until the bank says I have the money.	26
#Uh what? Why do you need that? I can't have you running my credit now.	26
That's fine by me. What's the method of payment?	26
Yes, how do I make payment.	26
Well I am wanting to see if I can set up a way to like pay automatically? Instead of my bill in the mail I just want to do it online or something.	26
Yes. How do I make payment.	26
Do i have to pay on that exact day.	26
yes...could you please help me make my first payment.	26
Look I just wanted to- I was told my that I hadn't paid for- and I was trying to pay. They said I didn't.	26
Oh that's good. can I pay it early?	26
Oh, well how have I been paying?	26
What day will the payments be on?	26
So the payment will just automatically come out my account every month right?	26
I don't remember doing anything like that. I was just checking to see how much my monthly payment was, is.	26
Thanks. What about the payment? Did my payment go through?	26
Ok. When are my payments coming out?	26
So, what will I have to pay today?	26
Oh, you mean if I have a loan. Um, no. It's paid for.	26
Ok. Would it be automatic payments?	26
So, does my payment come out the same time I used to pay online?	26
#Oh, right. No problem. Do I need to pay for that now?	26
Ok. So, how do I pay it back?	26
#Oh, actually, when will my first payment for the new plan come out?	26
Yes, the tenth works. Will I get a bill in the mail now? Cause I never did before.	26
Okay. So has my payment already been taken out this month? Can you check on there for me?	26
Right! Earlier I wanted to ask. Will adding my daughters as dependents on my account increase my premium?	27
my kids were all dependents of my late husband's policy. I would like to change that and make them dependents of my insurance policy.	27
I want your best advise. Do I open up an account for my daughter or adding her as a dependent on my account would be a better idea?	27
So what have I gotta do to get my dependent added to my account?	27
Yes I recently filed for divorce and I need to remove my husband from my health insurance.	27
Hello. I need to remove someone from my plan.	27

Yes, that's right. I just needed to add my daughter to the auto insurance as a driver.	27
I have some questions about adding a dependent to my health insurance policy. My daughter is living across town and shes currently not employed, so I'm helping her through a rough patch. I wondered if Id be able to add her to my health insurance. I don't want to see anything happen to her, but if it does, I want to know shes covered.	27
Is anyone else claiming her as a dependent?	27
If I wanted to add another dependent in the future, is there a way other than calling this helpline to do that?	27
Oh actually just in case if we ever needed to add her back could we?	27
Okay, will it allow me include my son? That was why i went for the highest among the plan when i subscribed.	27
Oh good, help me add my son.	27
um...i need help removing a dependent from my insurance plan.	27
you mean I can add more than one person.	27
Sure thing. Low price sounds good- how much extra will he like what's it going to cost to add him?	27
I need to add my daughter to my car insurance.	27
Hi there. I'm calling because I need to remove my son from our, my life insurance.	27
Fine. So, can you remove my son from my life insurance?	27
I was needing to take my kid off of our healthcare plan.	27
Well If I remove him now like today will our monthly payment for the this remaing for the rest of this month be like prorated or something?	27
What do you advise? Should I keep him on my account as a dependent or do I take him off my account. He did call to say I should take him off so my premiums would be reduced.	27
Yeah, I wanna take out my old card and put in details for my checking account.	28
Anyway, I need to give you my new card information.	28
Okay. Do I get a card or something?	28
I can use my card. What do you need from it?	28
That would be a lot easier, than calling up every month. Can you take it directly from my bank account, or does it have to come off a credit card?	28
#Uh what card is that?	28
Hi Miranda my name is Lee and I need to get a new card.	28
I was thinking maybe of cutting the card, you know? Try to improve the credit score while there's still time .	28
So my bank card was stolen and I think that's the card you guys have.	28
Yes exactly. I want to change it to my Amex card. Lemme know when you're ready for the information.	28
I have a Discover card and you need the card number, expiration date and security code right?	28
First do I have to pay the whole year upfront now and do you all take Paypal?	28
But Paypal takes it from my account so isn't it a bank transfer?	28
Okay I need to change it to my Visa card. What do you need? Card number obviously and then expiration date?	28
I would like to pay by card please. Do you take American Express?	28
Can I add a debit card or does it have to be a credit card?	28
And my card won't be charged until I talk to, with this Wendy person?	28
We have a credit card on file. Would you like us to charge the payments to that card?	28
Oh okay. And do the payments process quicker or slower with a checking account than the credit card?	28
I don't think so. Oh! Yes, when will I get new cards for my son?	28
Yes I just need to change the card I'm paying with.	28
And it will go to the new card? How much is it?	28
yes actually I just have one more question. What's the difference between paying with a card and my bank account?	28
Do you take American Express?	28
I'm back, and I realized my credit card is upstairs. Can I call you all back later or do this online?	28
Okay, sounds good. Would I also be able to change my payment card?	28
Can you use the card I've used before?	28
Cool, so can I pay you with a credit card?	28
Actually, I always pay with the same card. Is that on file?	28
Yeah, I'd like too. I was thinking putting it on my credit card, but are there other options like Paypal?	28
okay, so no Paypal or anthing like that.	28
I bet. Can I pay with a credit card?	28
And could I also change my card payment? I really need to get that changed.	28
Yes, I'd also like to change the card that is used for the auto payments.	28
How long until I get the new cards?	28
I usually make transfers monthly, but I will like to add my credit card details so I can be debited monthly.	28
#Um my card is not really close to me right now, I don't know why I didn't have it handy. Can I give you a call back or would you stay on the line while I get it?	28
No I didn't change anything. I wanna take my credit card off my account.	28
I can use my card. What do you need from it?	28
Oh! I was just going to change my credit card that I have on file? I know the one I have is about to expire.	28
My problem is that my wife has access to my credit card and keeps spending too much on it.	28
You say it expired? Which card is that?	28
Yes. I think the recurring payments to my card are damaging my credit? I just received a credit score, you know, one of those free ones they offer.	28
#Um hey this is Mark I wanted to get a pet quote and also can you help me change to card payment?	28
Nah is that on that card too?	28
Ok cool. Yes I want to pay by card please. But can you remind me the balance please?	28
Hi there. I need to talk to someone about changing my credit card payment for my account.	28
Uh yes I need to change the credit card for my account please.	28
Sure yeah can I put you on hold for just a sec. I thought I had my card but where did it go.	28
Oh okay ma'am charge it to the same card on file?	28
Got it payment is processing do you want your new cards to be mailed or emailed?	28
Mhm you guys have all my card info and whatnot right?	28
Ok fine I will be paying with my credit card. But first please remind me the balance due?	28
Can you just take the payment from this card every month?	28
Hey I need to change my payment method. I am getting paper bills in the mail and I want to set up a payment throught like my card? My credit card?	28
Thank you for holding I am back. I just had a slow systemt here I was trying to get things moving. So I will need to know what card you would like to set up a recurring payment with.	28
I need to change my card on file. I just got a new one.	28
Well, I guess I would need to change all of them since my card is a completely different number.	28
#Um, is my card on file or my checking?	28
Ok, so what about the card?	28
Right. So, where do I find the card? The download?	28

Ok great, wait, so if I get into an accident, then just my vehicle will be covered and myself, not the other driver or his car?	30
#Um need help with several things. Have some questions and need some information on pet insurance cause oh no need this first. I need to know if the room my foreign exchange student has is covered by Fair Rental Expense. Or is it Fair Rental Value?	30
I rent that room in the fall to a foreign exchange student, and if it ends up being major construction cannot do that. Have a due date to say yeah or nope to the student.	30
Thursday around ten thirty be good for me. Do I have to crawl with them in the attic?	30
Yeah, guess that makes sense. What do your records show for me?	30
No, not today. But, you've made this pretty pleasant and I'll definitely be calling back to get proof for the other vehicles digital. Hey, can I get the house digital as well?	30
Been reading all about this climate upping. I-I think the waters might decide to visit the house. So I need to add water protection to my homeowners policy.	30
Do I have any coverage for water flooding, Timothy? What am I suppose to do if that happens?	30
You're telling me no flood damage from outside is covered with my my policy?	30
#Um I am not going to remember all that. Do you have some papers I can see what waters are covered?	30
Yes my name is John Brown, policy number one two three four five six seven eight and I need to report an accident.	30
And what does emergency roadside do?	30
Correct. I need a lower deductible.	30
Huh. I'm wondering if a lower deductible is the way to go now. My son has had two accidents this year in the high school parking lot, but they were minor so I just paid out of pocket because my deductible is so high.	30
What's the deductible on it?	30
Oh yes. That's much better. And it includes rental coverage?	30
Yes my house was damaged in the last hurricane and I need to file a claim. I've been a customer for years so I hope it doesn't mess up my rates.	30
Yes. We got hit pretty hard here. Did you guys have any damage?	30
No, it's my first car, so I'm just calling around to get some idea of what different companies offer. A co worker said that they use your company. So I figured I might as well start with you.	30
Yeah do you have something with a little more personal property coverage?	30
So what happens now? My car is pretty bad.	30
How much is my deductible?	30
And that would have to be paid before you guys issue any money to fix it?	30
Well how much would it be if I got full coverage? That would buy me a new car if something happened right?	30
But that first one the forty dollars that wouldn't buy me a car huh?	30
Okay well how much for the one that would help me get a new car then?	30
What happened to your dad's car?	30
Yeah. So what does your dad drive now?	30
Do I need to give the police any more information?	30
Like tornadoes? Does it cover tornadoes?	30
I'm just trying to decide whether I want flood insurance or not.	30
Nah, that's okay. You can tell me all that when I call back with the information from the shelter.	30
What about if I had a party or something and someone did damage?	30
Okay m. Well I only have one car so I'm thinking I don't need the exceptional. Can you remind me what the lowest price plan is?	30
There aren't any earthquakes where I live. Is there a reduction if you eliminate that?	30
So, let's see. So, if I do go with the complete plan, backing out earthquake coverage, what would my monthly premium be?	30
Hi, I'm not sure who I should speak to, I just called the number on your website. I need to put in a claim, that windstorm last night brought down a big tree, right on top of our house. It hit the car too, and the garage. I'm not sure where to start.	30
What kind of protection does that one offer for like disasters or other circumstances?	30
Hello. I want to report an accident.	30
Oh, but, what if you have more than that in belongings?	30
Yeah. #Um, are their any deductibles with these plans?	30
So it pays me to fix the car or replace it?	30
No, I mean about the mistake. Will somebody be reprimanded for this?	30
And could I remove the, uh#, the emergency assistance?	30
OK. And does it affect let's say I get a ticket.	30
So could we get a shuttle to the car- the rental car lot? And then we get the car from there?	30
Like, would a newer truck cost more? Like that sort of thing?	30
OK, yeah. And could I, like, choose? Like, could I decide to have a higher premium and a lower de- deductible?	30
And would that be, like, on top of whatever, like ticket or fine? Like I would get dinged by the d. m. v. and also pay more for insurance?	30
I hope so! So we were wondering about adding earthquake insurance as well.	30
Cool! But how would I, like, prove it? What would I need to say in the claim? I mean, I wasn't home when it hit. I just saw the damage to the tree and kind of assumed, and I like don't know how I would.	30
OK, so would I, or how about I call a repair technician to get a quote. And then would I need to.	30
What's the deductible on an event like this?	30
What's the deductible on an event like this, Timothy?	30
In my considerations tornado shelters are underground sometimes with a hatch and sometimes with door. Do I get a discount on my homeowner's insurance if I let construction people dig up my flowers to put that in?	30
I believe so. I have been pricing safe rooms or looking at converting a room in the house to that. How does insurance work with that?	30
What about those self-contained safe rooms made to just put outside your home?	30
Yes, Timothy so how do I insure my safe room.	30
I need to file a claim, Craig. Storm did some roof damage, knocked a large tree down.	30
Did not see any on the ceiling. No puddles on the floor. Tree missed electrical lines. May be some fence damage but do not know till it is chopped up a bit. Do I get money for the tree?	30
Yeah, Hello I currently have an imminent issue with the police force. Someone bashed my car and I made it clear my insurance cover will not be able to suffice for the damage done, I will like to get a prove of insurance with your company.	30
Well, #em, I would like to know if I can report this on the website instead of having to make a call.	30
Thanks, I am just checking to see if I got an email back yet about the truck. Moving can be a lot.	30
Hey yeah, I have to call and report an accident.	30
I just want to uh, report this I didn't get cited the other fella did, but I want to make sure you know you guys knew I wasn't the one cited by the police.	30
Okay so when I get the uh, the uh, police report I call you back and will I talk to you?	30
Right, how much would it cost to add in personal injury assistance?	30
Yeah, Hello I currently have an imminent issue with the police force. Someone bashed my car and I made it clear my insurance cover will not be able to suffice for the damage done, I will like to get a prove of insurance with your company.	30
Well, #em, I would like to know if I can report this on the website instead of having to make a call.	30
Why does the car make a difference?	30
How much is the deductible?	30
Would there be a fine or penalty for this?	30
So I need to report the accident to you, correct?	30
Hi, I'd like to report an accident.	30
Can't you just send someone out here to assess the damage?	30
I'm calling regarding an accident that happened.	30
I wanted to know if there's any other way of reporting such cases like this other than calling the help line.	30
Oh don't you have to have a physical copy in your car?	30
No. actually I've been looking a car but I haven't decided if I am going to get it or not. Can you give me a quote?	30
And also the properties in case of any damage or theft in the house right?	30
Yes my name is John Brown, policy number one two three four five six seven eight and I need to report an accident.	30
And what does emergency roadside do?	30
Yes. Will this also cover if something happens in the apartment?	30
Yes my house was damaged in the last hurricane and I need to file a claim. I've been a customer for years so I hope it doesn't mess up my rates.	30
Yes. We got hit pretty hard here. Did you guys have any damage?	30
Yeah do you have something with a little more personal property coverage?	30
So what happens now? My car is pretty bad.	30
How much is my deductible?	30
And that would have to be paid before you guys issue any money to fix it?	30
Yeah, I need to report a property accident.	30
Yes. I'm walking around-and-oh dang it. Does my insurance cover furniture damage? Like, oh my gosh, the leak, it had to be from my bathroom upstairs. It just is all over my couch.	30
Oh, yeah. I understand. Okay. #Um, so would this, like, protect against any kind of, water damage to my stuff?	30
hmm what about whoever is in the car with me in the case of an accident?	30
Is it safe?	30
Does it, protect my stuff from water?	30
What about, mold? Does it protect against mold?	30
And it just protects against flooding?	30
Hello? Yeah, I need to-to report an accident.	30
Yes, I'm here at the Target and it looks like someone hit my car and just drove off.	30
And what if I'm able to get the license of the guy who hit me?	30
What if my husband fixes it? Can he claim the money for labor?	30
Yeah, hi I need to report a car accident.	30
Um, yeah. Id like to report an accident.	30
Does that. Can we do it that way? Is it ok not to call the police?	30
Do you advise me to involve the police? Er, what's your thought on that?	30
What's the highest deductable I can have?	30
I won't. Why would I have an accident?	30
You bought her a car? Can you buy me a car? I need a new one.	30
I haven't been to church in years. If I pray, will you buy me a new car?	30
You can buy a whole car on Facebook for less than five thousand dollars. Why would anyone choose that?	30
My car is so old. It might have an accident. What if I run into someone else? Like, an accident?	30
Yeah. I had a feeling this could get uncomfortable. Nobody wants to think about losing all their stuff. But without the insurance, where does it leave you, you know? Jeez.	30
Now what kind of disasters does this insurance cover? Everything but an earthquake?	30
I think the preferred. It depends on the liability limit. What's the liability limit on the basic one?	30
Let me get back to you on that. I might want to insure my boat that way. But about the liability limit for the basic?	30
Yes, but what about flooding?	30
Uh-huh can I put multiple cars?	30
Oh hi. Yes I need to I would like to file a report of damage to my house.	30
Oh yeah we are fine. Used to storms like this ya know. Just want to get the roof fixed and we'll be good.	30
So if there's like a robbery my stuff wouldn't be insured?	30
Oh is that like if my car gets messed up?	30
Hm okay okay, yes regular protocol. #Uh can I just report the accident already?	30
Hm, and how long does it take the claims people to review the uh-huh you know what? My name is Fallon Westley. What else do you need?	30
Okay, great. So do I get to give the report now?	30
Yeah, so what next, or is that all I have to do, just to narrate the incident? I thought I would get to make a claim, or how do I go about it?	30
Yes, definitely. Isn't that the end goal of reporting the incident in the first place?	30
Yeah, sure, I'm flowing. So, but what if the driver did not cause the accident, what happens?	30
Oh yeah, I was just going to ask if it covers the lost wages as well.	30
First i need to check my account balance then get clarity on how to report an automobile accident.	30
Alright, so how do i report an automobile accident?	30
So how do i make the report?	30
Okay, okay. So you guys will pay for the roof? My brother told me-.	30
Well what do I do about my roof while I wait on you guys?	30
Let me, my wife had some - What's the if I get in a wreck, my fault, how much I got to pay?	30
Five years? But what if it was just a little speeding ticket.	30
Yeah, got a car for my daughter now that she's moved back home.	30
I just moved into an apartment and I need to cover my furniture and stuff.	30
I think so. What are the, is the coverage?	30
Will I need flood insurance?	30
Yeah. Second story. So, the tree fell on the right side of the deck at the outer corner. I saw the metal railing bent and the big support pole under it snapped in half and the deck boards fell down onto the ground. Some were snapped in half and some are still, uh, hanging down from the deck that's still intact, but I worry if there's, structural problems with the other side.	30
Does it have to match my drivers license?	30
That's not secure is it?	30
Well, I need to see if my wife's, soon to be ex-wife's name is still on my auto.	30
What about emergency care? Does it cover that?	30
Ok. I understand. Is it important to have a lot of liability?	30
Hi. #Um, well, I'm calling because I have no fence as of yesterday and I need to get it fixed right away.	30
So, what happens now? Is my car covered?	30
#Um, no, but are they going to call me about the complaint?	30
So, what do I tell my landlord? Should I hire someone to come get the furniture or take it to the dump?	30
#Oh. Wow. I didn't even think about that. Isn't there a death thing on the auto.	30
Whoa. That's higher than last month. What made it change?	31
how much is that a month?	31
What are the monthly costs for each of those?	31
how much is that a month?	31
Can I, pay this one, monthly?	31
Hey yes I have a renewal coming up and I usually pay only once a year but this year I can't make one large payment. I need to see if I can do it monthly.	31
Yes I want to see if I can change my payment from monthly to annually. I keep forgetting to pay it every month.	31
how much more is it a year than what I have?	31
Can I pay it monthly?	31
Do you guys offer monthly plans or do you have to pay at one time?	31
Grace period. What do you mean grace period?	31
#Er monthly please. How much would that be exactly?	31
Well I am not sure what I am looking to do. I want to change my bill to monthly?	31
Can you repeat the monthly billing amount please?	31
And what about the extra two hundred dollars? When does that start? #Um how do I pay it?	31
Oh, alright. How much would it be per month?	31
Was that paid in full because I don't think I pay anything monthly for it.	31
What month was that?	31
How much does that come out to every month.	31
yeah that the word frequency. I want to change to the frequency of how often I pay to every month.	31
Alright so I can just keep paying monthly then?	31
Was that paid in full because I don't think I pay anything monthly for it.	31
What month was that?	31
How much does that come out to every month.	31
How much would that be a month?	31
And that's every month?	31
Hi, I was wanting to change my billing from yearly to monthly, can I do that?	31
So three hundred a year for that. Do you allow monthly payments or do I have to pay that up front?	31
Good. And, I forgot what you said. What the monthly amount is?	31
Wow, that'll help me out a lot. What does that break down to monthly?	31
OK, so yeah. I'll get that sorted out. And it'll be monthly.	31
Is there a option for six months? That's what I've got for my car.	31
OK, and what would the annual rate be, if I decided to pay it all at once?	31
A month or annually?	31
And how much is that a year?	31
How much is it a month?	31
Well how much is it a month?	31
I would like to change the billing frequency on my account please. That once a year payment for auto insurance is a big hit.	31
Yes, I want to do the monthly billing instead of the once per year bill.	31
Do I have to pay for a whole year at onec or can I do payments every six months?	31
Is that one one thousand per year?	31
are there any benefits to paying all at once? Like any discounts or anything?	31
Oh, okay. You can't do every six months or something?	31
Can we change that to the beginning of the month?	31
How much is the payment supposed to be per month? I was charged more than two hundred dollars!	31
Okay and How much is the yearly payment for each of them?	31
Ok. I would like to update from monthly to quarterly then.	31
Well, when did my contract begin?	31
What is my contract term and when does my contract end?	31
Hey yes I have a renewal coming up and I usually pay only once a year but this year I can't make one large payment. I need to see if I can do it monthly.	31
Yes I want to see if I can change my payment from monthly to annually. I keep forgetting to pay it every month.	31
Can I pay it monthly?	31
Do you guys offer monthly plans or do you have to pay at one time?	31
And will that still be on the first of the month?	31
A month?! You wanna make me pay one thousand a month! That is ridiculous-.	31
Yeah, that sounds about right. Can we just stick to that or will I have to-have to do monthly payments?	31
How much would I pay?	31
How much would I pay, again?	31
Well, how much is once? I mean, like, how much do I pay if I pay once?	31
What's that work out to a year?	31
Whoa that's great so would you recommend the yearly rates or annual.	31
Eee I think at the end of the month? Can I do that?	31
Can i switch from the yearly to the monthly?	31
What's it per month?	31
How much monthly?	31
Look I'm just-, I don't- I'm busy right now with work and I just want to know how much it'll cost-.	31
Yep how much do y'all pay? How much do I pay?	31
Yes, I want to switch from paying every six months to the monthly plan.	31
Okay, how much will my monthly payments be?	31
okay can you tell me what monthly payment is too?	31
Ok. #Um what is the monthly payment?	31
What was the monthly again on the Universal?	31
#Um, I don't know. Can I pay monthly?	31
Hi. I'm getting charged every six months for my auto insurance and I want to change it to monthly.	31
What is that monthly?	31
Ok, what is that all monthly.	31
Can you tell me how much more it's going to be a month?	31
Would I pay monthly?	31
Ok and what would it be monthly?	31
Right. Ok. So, what if I went with every six months? When would it come out?	31
So, what is the monthly payment. I didn't write it down.	31
#Oh. For payment. Right. Is it monthly?	31
#Hm. What's that monthly?	31
Two hundred and one hundred. Got it. So, how much are the monthly payments for each?	31
