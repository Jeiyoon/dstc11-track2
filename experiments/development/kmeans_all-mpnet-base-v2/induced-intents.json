So we were wondering about adding earthquake insurance as well.", "I just moved into an apartment and I need to cover my furniture and stuff.", "Yeah, are they both, like, required? Do I need them to be legally insured?", "You're telling me no flood damage from outside is covered with my my policy?", "If I come up with a commerical enterprise after the flight. Can it be insured?", "Well m I don't think I need that much coverage probably do I? What do you think?", "Um, no I don't think I want to schedule that now. Wait what's an insurance review?", "Now what kind of disasters does this insurance cover? Everything but an earthquake?", "[sounds of typing] And, while I'm doing this, how much coverage, what's the coverage?", "What kind of protection does that one offer for like disasters or other circumstances?", "Do they have kind of the same coverage tiers as the auto insurance but with home coverage?", "Mhm so if my dog were to break a leg or something bad like that it would be covered right?", "Let me, my wife had some - What's the if I get in a wreck, my fault, how much I got to pay?", "Yeah, yeah. It's that one. Renter's Basic. I was just wondering, what, like what it covers?", "Do I have any coverage for water flooding, Timothy? What am I suppose to do if that happens?", "Wow, that's more that I thought it would be, but I guess it's worth it. What does that cover?", "Okay, that sounds better. You said there was three levels? What is the highest level of coverage?", "Okay well she's gotta be insured and so does the car so. What does that bring my monthly total to?", "Um, so does it cover any over the counter medications, like heart worm medication or anything like that?", "Actually now that you mention it, my tooth has been hurting me. What's the deductible on our dental again?", "Well how much would it be if I got full coverage? That would buy me a new car if something happened right?", "None of my info has changed, so, fifteen hundred and two thousand. Ok. So, what are the coverages for each?", "And will insurance take care of any medical bills I need because this wasn't my fault someone ran a stop sign and hit me.", "Ok great, wait, so if I get into an accident, then just my vehicle will be covered and myself, not the other driver or his car?", "So, like, are you saying if I have a guest over and he or she gets injured in my house, this package covers the hospital bills?", "And would that be, like, on top of whatever, like ticket or fine? Like I would get dinged by the d. m. v. and also pay more for insurance?", "What about if something happens to her, physically, and she needs like those little wheels on her back legs to get around. Would it cover that?", "Are you serious? So what? People can't get insurance if their house has aluminum wiring? How the hell does that work? You need insurance to get a mortgage?", "Great. Right. #Er, I'm sorry. Does Rivertown cover cars? It's just, we had to cancel our previous insurance for for a number of reasons, and I've got two vehicles I need to cover.", "And so even if I get both, are there, like, different amounts? Like I pay more for higher coverage? Or I maybe pay less at first but then, like, I have to pay more for, like, repairs or something?", "Huh. I'm wondering if a lower deductible is the way to go now. My son has had two accidents this year in the high school parking lot, but they were minor so I just paid out of pocket because my deductible is so high."]}

The most expensive.", "That seems a bit steep to me. Is there any cheaper plan?", "Is there a Whole Life plan that we can also borrow against?", "I think so.

What do I get with my plan now?", "That's good to know. #Um what's the difference between the plans?", "Mhm, before I go actaully do you have a list of the plans you have?", "Okay. I think I-I want the Basic plan still. How much was it again?", "Sounds good. So what are the available plans and how much does it cost?", "Uh-huh sounds all good to me what coverages does this preferred plan have?", "Can I have a link to read over the details, options, and possible expenses?", "Whew. What's your basic plan? The cheapest. I'm not made of money you know.", "And my plan started on I guess my question is do you guys do retroactive discounts?", "I know it is. Yeah, go ahead and sign me up for the hundred sixty-four dollar plan.", "You mentioned extras and bonuses for the last plan, d-does this plan have that too?", "I guess Ill have to take what I can get. Is that the cheapest plan you have available?", "Okay.

And I'm assuming that the second plan comes with more coverage?", "Well, I'm just gonna have to think about that. Can you send me information about the different plans? Cuz I gotta go.", "I'll say. I think I need more information on each type of plan. I looked on your website, but I'm feeling confused now.", "Okay m. Well I only have one car so I'm thinking I don't need the exceptional. Can you remind me what the lowest price plan is?", "So todays date, July thirtieth, twenty twenty-one, you are enrolled in the HPG Choice Plan. How would you like to pay for that?", "I saved up a long time, I'm so excited, no more riding the bus! I don't get it until next week, so I might be calling back to get coverage.", "#Uh okay, so is it just those two plans because I feel like the other agent mentioned something like Auto Comprehensive or is it the Comprehensive Auto now?", "Hi, thanks for waiting. I think we're actually interested in the middle plan, the one with the both house and belongings included, but I think we'd like to review the fine print before we move forward.", "Actually, I just need to understand the plans available under the automobile package and how they work, although, basically, based on what the agent sort of explained, I had it in mind to go with the Basic package, but I think if I know how the rest work properly, I will be confident on which to go for, you know?"]}

My ex-husband had access to my account and knew my security questions and now we're not married anymore so I need to change them.", "Well, I don't like giving out my social security number if I don't have to.

I'm locked out of the online portal because I can't remember one of them.", "I just wondered about the security. How do those questions work? When I go to log in, it asks me a question. If I get it wrong, it asks me a different one. If I get that wrong, I'm locked out. Is that how it works?"]}
